<div style="width:400px;text-align:justify;line-height:100%"><font style="font-size: 24px;font-family:Just Another Hand">Cosmos is a Greek word for the order of the universe. It is, in a way, the opposite of Chaos. It implies the deep interconnectedness of all things. It conveys awe for the intricate and subtle way in which the universe is put together.

Duskthorne is gone. There was an earthquake along the beam, I think. I was in the workshop. I couldn't find father. Everything was destroyed, not built to last through a thing like this. More and more people are leaving. I can't blame them. I think I need to go, too. Not because I've given up on this place, but because I have to. If I was waiting for a sign, this must be it, and while I hate to think of what it might have cost me - what it will still cost me - I know I just can't squander it.<p>
  
  I think I had a message from Bessa. I was working on a whistle and whatever happened in the shaking it got struck into a rose. It sounds crazy to write it down like that, but that's what happened. Maybe I'm just reading into things, father always said I was too imaginative, but I don't care if nobody else believes it. I don't even really care if I die doing this. Not that I want to die, but I just don't want to live like I have been any more. Doing nothing. Letting it all pass me by. Giving up.<p>
  
  Erast says he'll go tomorrow. I'll join his group. See about telling him the whole story, too. If anyone'd be willing to understand...<p>
  
  I love you, dad. I hope wherever you are is good.<p>
