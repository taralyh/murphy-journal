- New stars... possible constellation? overhead, just to the west. [drawing]<p>

Duskthorne is gone. There was an earthquake along the beam, I think. I was in the workshop. I couldn't find father. Everything was destroyed, not built to last through a thing like this. More and more people are leaving. I can't blame them. I think I need to go, too. Not because I've given up on this place, but because I have to. If I was waiting for a sign, this must be it, and while I hate to think of what it might have cost me - what it will still cost me - I know I just can't squander it.<p>
  
  I think I had a message from Bessa. I was working on a whistle and whatever happened in the shaking it got struck into a rose. It sounds crazy to write it down like that, but that's what happened. Maybe I'm just reading into things, father always said I was too imaginative, but I don't care if nobody else believes it. I don't even really care if I die doing this. Not that I want to die, but I just don't want to live like I have been any more. Doing nothing. Letting it all pass me by. Giving up.<p>
  
  E says he'll go tomorrow. I'll join his group. See about telling him the whole story, too. If anyone'd be willing to understand...<p>
  
  I love you, dad. I hope wherever you are is good.<p>

  Traveling. Wishing it were under better circumstances, but when I tell you it's amazing... terrifying in the best of ways. I think I was meant for it. E thinks I'm just trying to find an escape from reality. Maybe he's right, but the funny thing is I don't miss duskthorne so much as I miss the people in it. Every day we move south is a day I can breathe better. <p>
  
  Been looking for that constellation I thought I saw. Telescope broken in the quake - mirror's cracked, and that thing was hard to come by in the first place, but I'll keep searching. Can't find those stars with the naked eye. Been coming across some of the old tech here and there. Mar would rather go all the way round, but I've been ducking in for supplies. Don't think her or E are too happy about it.<P>
  
  No time to sketch on the road, but here's some from memory:<P>
  
  [old gas station]<p>

  This was probalby inevitable. I've split off from E and Mar. First night on my own. The wind feels so much louder like this. I've figured out a bell to hang on the tent door, lets me know when it's been opened. Like a shock inside my mind. Don't know if that'd give me time to react to anything, but it does make me feel safer. I'm glad for the summer and its warmth - can't imagine being out here like this in the dark and cold. <p>
  
  No stars tonight. Telescope still isn't fixed, anyway. Been fine-tuning Marshall. He's still having balance issues, needs a stronger grip maybe.<P>

  Made it to Oaktown. Quiet here. Mostly just farmers, not helped by the trains stopping. I offered my hands, and either they were in sore need or they took pity on me because they've given me room and board in exchange. Been fixing up some things for them, they say I can take whatever spare parts I scrounge. There's a waystation a ways out, too, they say things show up there. I haven't been yet. I'll go tomorrow.<p>
  
  It's funny. There's so many places like that. And people just leave them be, don't wanna ask questions. Where does all that stuff come from? Why do those places always feel a bit funny? Like you're being watched or something. I wonder if you could measure those places the way you measure temperature. Might be worth looking into.<p>
  
  Still no glass for the telescope, but I've got decent food and a bed. Guess I needed some comfort after everything, after all, because I like it here. For now. Even if it's not a staying kind of place.<P>

  At the waystation. They weren't lying, there's all kinds of stuff out here.<p>
  
  [sketches]<p>
  
  Gonna take some things back to fiddle with. Might revisit the spinning shard contraption I've been trying to figure out. It lifts the metal pieces up now, but for the life of me I can't get them to stay there longer than a few seconds. Haven't even thought about making them spin, yet, but it's not much good for protection otherwise.<p>
